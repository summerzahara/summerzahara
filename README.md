### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Summer and I am learning to code! I enjoy projects in Python and am expanding my skills to include Javascript and React. In the future, I am interesting in learning Solidity and Rust for Web3 Development and Flutter for mobile development. You can follow my journey on twitter at twitter.com/summercodes_.
